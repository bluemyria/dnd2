        // 1. We set id = a unique CARD_ID_WHEN_COPYING on any clones (if they

        //    See store.ts.

        // 2. We don't get to modify the inFlight data, so instead, we compare
        //    ground.id to CARD_ID_WHEN_COPYING when we're copying.
        //
        // You can see for yourself that there is never more than one card with
        // CARD_ID_WHEN_COPYING, so:
        //
        // a. trackBy still returns a different value for every card on the
        //    board;
        // b. exactly one card will return true from isDragging.
        // c. that card will be the clone if copying, otherwise the original.
        // d. as long as the clone follows the hover around like the original
        //    normally does, it stays in place.
